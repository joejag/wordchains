Write a program that solves word-chain puzzles:

Find a chain of words start starting with one particular word and ending with another. Successive entries in the chain must all be real words, and each can differ from the previous word by just one letter. For example, you can get from "cat" to "dog" using the following chain.
  
    cat
    cot
    cog
    dog
  
The objective of this kata is to write a program that accepts start and end words and, using words from the dictionary, builds a word chain between them. Find the shortest word chain that solves each puzzle

You can turn lead into gold with the following chain:
      
    lead
    load
    goad
    gold
  
Try to capture the developer mindset and record how you to got to your solution.
